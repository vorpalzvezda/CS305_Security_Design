# CS305 Software Security - Module 8 Journal

## Client Summary
> Artemis Financial is a consulting firm that develops individualized financial plans for customers, including savings management, retirement strategies, investments, and insurance products. The organization sought to modernize its RESTFUL web application to better protect client data and defend against external security threats.
> 
## What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
> When I identified a vulnerability within the client's application, the one thing I did well was thoroughly assess the risk and document my findings. This allowed me to review additional documentation and consider possible solutions, effectively crafting a mitigation plan using my findings.
>   
> Secure coding is a critical requirement, especially within the context of a financial institution. Without implementing proven patterns and regulated standards an organization would be vulnerable to theft, and consequently, legal action. In a more generalized sense, secure coding is essential to ensuring the functionality and behavior of your program. Without proper validation and secure internal logic malicious actors could directly influence the behavior of your code, or worse, the machines it runs on. This is especially dangerous for cloud-hosted applications.
>
> Software security adds value to a company's well-being by fostering better trust with its' clients. Protecting user data and minimizing the risk of breaches increases the visibility of a company's products. Ultimately, this boosts productivity, reduces operational complexity, and strengthens the company's market share by being a trusted institution. 

## Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
> The most challenging part of the assessment was interpreting the Dependency-Check vulnerability report. Distinguishing between genuine vulnerabilities and false positives required careful analysis of CVE reports. However, this process was helpful in determining whether a vulnerability was directly exploitable or could be mitigated through configurations. This strengthened my understanding of how to interpret a security report more critically rather than relying on automated output, and the importance of dependency management (i.e., versioning). 

## How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
> 

## How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

## Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
